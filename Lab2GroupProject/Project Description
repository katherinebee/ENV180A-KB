Create a 1-2 markdown page, which will be your group's project proposal. Make sure to include the following:

An introduction of your research question
An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
Include datasource with links
A description, accompanied by a visual flow chart that explains the methodology for the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project
A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research

My research question: Is PM2.5 daily averaged concentrations higher in areas of higher respiratory illness prevalence in California Counties?


PM2.5 is 
This research project is important because by drawing a correlation between areas of high PM2.5 concentrations, at a county level in California, we can draw a correlation between respiratory ilnesses rates. It is important to examine areas of California that have both high averaged daily PM2.5 concentations and high hospitalization rates in order to advocate for protective policies that could potentially limit the amount of PM2.5 exposure.
